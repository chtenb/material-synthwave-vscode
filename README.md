# Material Synthwave VS Code theme
A very simple and probably visually not-so-great mash-up of Robb Owen's [SynthWave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/) window coloring and equinusocio's [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/vsc-material-theme) font colorings.

I've made no other changes than those.

## Installation
[Install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nexxai.material-synthwave-vscode).

## Contributions
By all means, submit a PR for any changes you'd make to this.  I'm not expecting anyone but myself to use it anyways so if even one other person decides it's not murder on the eyes, I feel morally bound to listen to their suggestions and will likely merge them without discussion.
